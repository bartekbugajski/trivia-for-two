# Project Title

This Trivia game consists of movie questions for 2 players. 
Each player gets to answer 10 questions and after the round finishes the screen re-loads.

### Prerequisites

I have avoided using CocoaPods and in the future versions I would like to keep it like that.
HTML decoding though is proving difficult therefore I might be forced to use some Pods.

The same goes for the future version where I would like to setup a CoreDataMode,
that would fetch a bunch of questions along with keeping a track of users, scores and dates.
